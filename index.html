        <p class="introductory">The <strong>sundews</strong> are carnivorous plants - they eat animals instead of being eaten by them. It's a fascinating group of plants that provides insights into plant evolution, the importance of environment for it and recognition of carnivorous traits in the plant kingdom.</p>

                 <p class="content">The sundews, known as <span class="latin">
                    Drosera</span> in scientific literature, are a genus of plants, with at least 194 different species. Sundew species can be found across the globe - on all continents except for Antarctica.</p>
                 <p class="content">
                    Sundews are carnivorous plants - they derve a large part of their necessary nutriens by consuming animals, typically bugs, that they catch with the mucous on their leaves. The sticky substance is secreted on their leaves in little glassy beads, giving them their common English name - <em>sundews</em>. Likewise, their Latvian name "<em>rasene</em>"" also references this characteristic.</p>
                 <p class="content">
                    Like many other carnivorous plants, sundews are found primarily in nutrient-poor habitats - marshes, swamps and other waterlogged places. They can survive in these environments because of their carnivory, or, perhaps, evolved carnivory to survive there.</p>
                 <p class="content">
                    Even Charles Darwin, who expermented much with one of the sundew species <span class="latin">Drosera rotundifolia</span>, admitted in a letter to a friend:</p>
                 <p class="citation">"…at the present moment, I care more about Drosera than the origin of all the species in the world."</p>

                    <p class="content">
                        The defining feature of the <span class="latin">Drosera</span> genus is its carnivory - the ability to not only attract and trap, but also digest prey, usually small insects and other invertebrates.</p>
                    <p class="content">
                        The main adaptations that make this possible are:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Attraction</strong>: sundew leaves are covered with little hair-like growths that sport little beads of sweet mucous that invites insects to visit the plant.</li>
                            <li><strong>Trapping</strong>: the sweet mucous is also sticky, trapping the prey. As it trashes about, trying to escape, it touches more and more beads, digging its own little sweet, sticky grave deeper.</li>
                            <li><strong>Digestion</strong>: As the leave curls around the ensnared victim, it secrets enzymes that break down the nutrients in the prey's body. The nutritious juices are then absorbed by the leaf.</li></ol>
                    <p class="content">
                        The hair-like tentacles of sundews are extremely sensitive and even mobile. Not only can they sense that a prey has touched them, they will also bend towards the center of the leaf in response, pushing the would-be dinner towards ever more tentacles.</p>
                    <p class="content">
                        Today, botanists recognize many carnivorous plant species, most of them not belonging to the <span class="latin">Drosera</span> genus, but representing a diverse group of otherwise not closely related genera and families, such as the pitcher plants (<span class="latin">Nepenthes spp.</span> and <span class="latin">Heliamphora spp</span>, among others) or the dramatic Venus flytrap (<span class="latin">Dionaea muscipula</span>). These plants employe a diverse range of strategies to attract and ensnare their meals. </p>
                    <p> 
                        However, it was the relatively inconspicuous sundew, which was extensively studied by European botanists in the 19th century, that lead to the recognition of the fact of carnivory itself - plant do indeed derive nutrition from they prey and they are not just victims to unfortunate accidents. </p>

                       With  <span class="latin">Drosera</span> genus having so many species and a cosmopolitan distribution, it is no wonder that a few of them are found also in Northeastern Europe, including Latvia.

                        <li><span class="latin">D. rotundifolia</span> (Latvian: "<em>apaļlapu rasene</em>") is the most common species in Latvia. Its leaves are rounded and resemble a tennis racket or a mandolin with a very long neck. It is common in wetlands all throughout the country.</li>
                        <li><span class="latin">D. anglica</span> (Latvian: "<em>garlapu rasene</em>") is the second most common sundew species in Latvia. Its leaves are much longer and narrower. The species is found all throughout the country, but not as often as the round-leaf sundew.</li>
                        <li><span class="latin">D. x obovata</span> (Latvian: "<em>ieapaļā rasene</em>") is a naturally occuring hybrid of the two above species. This species is sterile, as is often the case for interspecific hybrids. It can be found wherever its parent species are both present.</li>
                        <li><span class="latin">D. intermedia</span> (Latvian: "<em>vidējā rasene</em>") is the rarest species in Latvia, limited to lakeshares and mires on the western coast of the country.</li>
